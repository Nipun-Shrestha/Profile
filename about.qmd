I am a research-focused epidemiologist and a trained medical doctor (Nepal) with exceptional track record. My major areas of research interests are advanced epidemiological methods and next generation evidence synthesis approaches, such as prospective meta-analysis, and individual participant data meta-analysis. I am highly proficient in management of large observational/trial datasets and advanced systematic review methodologies. I have authored 18 systematic reviews, some of which have informed the development of international guidelines.
